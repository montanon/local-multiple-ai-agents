## Overview

The Git Worktree Helper Script provides a suite of powerful commands (`cwt`, `dwt`, `lwt`, `swt`, `uwt`) that simplify the creation, deletion, listing, switching, and updating of Git worktrees. It's designed with security, cross-shell compatibility, and user experience in mind.

**What are Git Worktrees?**
Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories (worktrees) attached to a single repository. This enables you to work on different branches simultaneously without constantly switching contexts or maintaining multiple repository clones.

**Why use this script?**
- 🚀 Simplified worktree management with intuitive commands
- 🔒 Built-in security with input validation and sanitization
- 🔄 Automatic configuration file copying (.env, .claude, etc.)
- 🎯 Interactive and scriptable modes
- 🛡️ Safe deletion with uncommitted change detection
- 📊 Rich status information and tracking
- 🔀 Cross-shell compatibility (bash/zsh)

---

## Features

✨ **Core Functionality**
- Create worktrees with new or existing branches
- Delete worktrees with safety checks and cleanup
- List all worktrees with detailed status information
- Switch between worktrees interactively or directly
- Update/pull multiple worktrees efficiently

📦 **Automation**
- Automatic editor opening (configurable)
- Configuration file copying (`.env`, `.claude`, `.cursor`, etc.)
- Remote tracking and sync status checking
- Uncommitted change detection

⚙️ **Configuration**
- Project-level configuration via `.git-worktree-config`
- Environment variable support
- Customizable editor, file copying, and directory copying

🛡️ **Security**
- Comprehensive input validation
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Safe cleanup on failures

---

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Shell**: bash 4.0+ or zsh 5.0+
- **Optional**: `fzf` for enhanced interactive selection in `swt` command

### System Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Unix-like system
- Basic command-line utilities: `git`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `find`

---

## Installation

### Method 1: Source in Shell Configuration

1. **Download or clone the script:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/scripts  # or your preferred location
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/git-worktree-helper/main/git-worktrees.sh
   ```

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x git-worktrees.sh
   ```

3. **Source it in your shell configuration:**

   **For bash** (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
   ```bash
   source ~/scripts/git-worktrees.sh
   ```

   **For zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   source ~/scripts/git-worktrees.sh
   ```

4. **Reload your shell:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Method 2: Add to PATH

1. **Move the script to a directory in your PATH:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp git-worktrees.sh /usr/local/bin/git-worktrees
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-worktrees
   ```

2. **Source it in your shell configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   source /usr/local/bin/git-worktrees
   ```

### Verify Installation

Test that the commands are available:
```bash
cwt --help
lwt --help
```

---

## Configuration

### Configuration File: `.git-worktree-config`

Create a `.git-worktree-config` file in your repository root to customize the script's behavior for that specific project.

#### Configuration File Location

```
your-repo/
├── .git/
├── .git-worktree-config    ← Place config here
└── ... (other files)
```

#### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `EDITOR` | string | `cursor` | Editor command to open worktrees |
| `COPY_FILES` | comma-separated | `.env` | Files to copy into new worktrees |
| `COPY_DIRS` | comma-separated | `.instrumental,.claude,.cursor` | Directories to copy into new worktrees |
| `AUTO_OPEN` | boolean | `true` | Automatically open worktrees in editor |
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | string | `(empty)` | Custom worktree directory pattern |

#### Configuration File Example

Create `.git-worktree-config` in your repository root:

```bash
# Git Worktree Configuration

# Editor to use (e.g., code, cursor, vim, nvim)
EDITOR=cursor

# Comma-separated list of files to copy into new worktrees
# Common examples: .env, .env.local, config.json
COPY_FILES=.env,.env.local,.npmrc

# Comma-separated list of directories to copy into new worktrees
# Common examples: .claude, .cursor, .vscode, .idea
COPY_DIRS=.instrumental,.claude,.cursor,.vscode

# Automatically open worktree in editor after creation (true/false)
AUTO_OPEN=true

# Custom worktree path pattern (leave empty for default)
# Default pattern: <parent-dir>/<project-name>-worktrees/<branch-name>
WORKTREE_PATH=
```

#### Configuration Validation

The script validates all configuration values to prevent security issues:
- **EDITOR**: Checked for shell metacharacters and command injection patterns
- **COPY_FILES/COPY_DIRS**: Validated for safe characters only
- **AUTO_OPEN**: Must be `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `1`, or `0`
- **WORKTREE_PATH**: Checked for path traversal and injection attempts

**Security Note:** If invalid characters are detected, the script falls back to safe defaults and displays a warning.

## Commands

### `cwt` - Create Worktree

Create a new git worktree with a new or existing branch.

#### Synopsis

```bash
cwt [OPTIONS] <feature-name>
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e, --existing` | Checkout an existing branch instead of creating a new one |
| `-n, --no-open` | Skip opening the worktree in editor |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

#### Behavior

1. **Validates** the feature/branch name for safety
2. **Creates** worktree directory at `<parent>/<project>-worktrees/<feature-name>`
3. **Creates or checks out** the specified branch
4. **Copies** configured files and directories (`.env`, `.claude`, etc.)
5. **Opens** the worktree in your configured editor (unless `-n` is used)

#### Examples

**Create a new branch and worktree:**
```bash
cwt feature-123
# Creates branch "feature-123" and worktree at:
# ../my-project-worktrees/feature-123/
```

**Checkout an existing local branch:**
```bash
cwt -e main
# Checks out existing "main" branch in a new worktree
```

**Checkout a remote branch:**
```bash
cwt -e origin/hotfix-456
# Checks out remote branch "origin/hotfix-456"
# Creates local tracking branch "hotfix-456"
```

**Create worktree without opening editor:**
```bash
cwt -n testing
# Creates worktree but doesn't launch editor
# Useful for scripting or batch operations
```

**Complex feature branch:**
```bash
cwt feature/user-authentication
# Branch name: feature/user-authentication
# Worktree: ../my-project-worktrees/feature/user-authentication/
```

#### Input Validation

The script validates branch names to prevent issues:
- ❌ No spaces
- ❌ No shell metacharacters (`$`, `` ` ``, `|`, `&`, `;`, `<`, `>`)
- ❌ No git ref special characters (`~`, `^`, `:`, `?`, `*`, `[`)
- ❌ No path traversal (`../`)
- ❌ Cannot start with `.` or end with `.lock`
- ❌ Cannot end with `.` or `/`
- ❌ No double slashes (`//`) or `@{` sequences

#### Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling:
- **Cleanup on failure**: Removes partial worktrees and branches if creation fails
- **Branch conflict detection**: Warns if branch already exists (local or remote)
- **Path conflict detection**: Prevents overwriting existing worktrees

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GWT_EDITOR` | `cursor` | Editor to launch |
| `GWT_COPY_FILES` | `.env` | Files to copy |
| `GWT_COPY_DIRS` | `.instrumental,.claude,.cursor` | Directories to copy |
| `GWT_AUTO_OPEN` | `true` | Auto-open in editor |

---

### `dwt` - Delete Worktree

Delete the current git worktree and optionally its associated branch.

#### Synopsis

```bash
dwt [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-f, --force` | Skip all confirmations (for scripting) |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

#### Behavior

1. **Verifies** you're inside a worktree (not the main repository)
2. **Displays** worktree information (path, branch, file count, uncommitted changes)
3. **Prompts** for confirmation (unless `-f` is used)
4. **Removes** the worktree
5. **Optionally deletes** the associated branch
6. **Prevents** deletion of branches checked out in other worktrees

#### Examples

**Interactive deletion:**
```bash
cd ../my-project-worktrees/feature-123
dwt
# Shows worktree details
# Prompts: "Delete this worktree? [y/N]:"
# If yes, prompts: "Delete branch 'feature-123' too? [y/N]:"
```

**Force deletion (no prompts):**
```bash
dwt -f
# Immediately deletes worktree
# Automatically deletes associated branch
# Useful for automation/scripts
```

#### Safety Features

**Uncommitted Changes Detection:**
The script detects and displays:
- Modified files
- Staged files
- Untracked files

**Branch Protection:**
- Refuses to delete branches that are checked out in other worktrees
- Shows clear warnings when uncommitted changes exist

**Example Output:**
```
Worktree: feature-login
Path:     /Users/user/projects/app-worktrees/feature-login
Main repo: /Users/user/projects/app
Branch:   feature-login
Files:    47

UNCOMMITTED CHANGES DETECTED:
   Modified files: 3
   Staged files: 1
   Untracked files: 2

Delete this worktree? [y/N]:
```

#### Lock File Handling

If a `index.lock` file is detected after deletion, the script:
- Reports the lock file location
- Attempts to list processes holding the lock (using `lsof`)
- Provides instructions for manual removal if it's stale

---

### `lwt` - List Worktrees

List all git worktrees with detailed information.

#### Synopsis

```bash
lwt [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

#### Output Information

For each worktree, displays:
- 📁 **Name** (with `[CURRENT]` marker)
- 📍 **Path** (absolute path to worktree)
- 🌿 **Branch** (or detached HEAD info)
- ✅ **Status** (`[CLEAN]` or `[DIRTY]`)
- 💬 **Last commit** (message, author, relative time)

#### Examples

**Basic listing:**
```bash
lwt
```

**Example Output:**
```
==========================================================================
  GIT WORKTREES
==========================================================================

[CURRENT] feature-login
   Path:   /Users/user/projects/app-worktrees/feature-login
   Branch: feature-login
   Status: [DIRTY] dirty
   Commit: Add login form validation
           by John Doe, 2 hours ago

  main
   Path:   /Users/user/projects/app
   Branch: main
   Status: [CLEAN] clean
   Commit: Merge pull request #42
           by Jane Smith, 1 day ago

           by Security Team, 3 hours ago

==========================================================================
```

#### Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `[CURRENT]` | You are currently in this worktree |
| `[CLEAN]` | No uncommitted changes |
| `[DIRTY]` | Has uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked files) |

#### Use Cases

- Quick overview of all active worktrees
- Check which branches are checked out
- Identify worktrees with uncommitted changes
- Find the path to a specific worktree

---

### `swt` - Switch Worktrees

Switch between git worktrees interactively or directly.

#### Synopsis

```bash
swt [OPTIONS] [worktree-name]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p, --print` | Print the worktree path instead of opening editor |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

#### Behavior

**Interactive Mode** (no worktree-name provided):
- Uses `fzf` for fuzzy searching (if available)
- Falls back to numbered menu selection
- Displays all worktrees with branch names

**Direct Mode** (worktree-name provided):
- Matches against worktree names and branch names
- Opens the first match in your editor

**Print Mode** (`-p` flag):
- Prints the selected worktree path to stdout
- Useful for shell integration: `cd $(swt -p)`

#### Examples

**Interactive selection with fzf:**
```bash
swt
# Opens fzf interface
# Type to filter worktrees
# Press Enter to select
```

**Interactive selection without fzf:**
```bash
swt
# Output:
# Available worktrees:
#
#   1) main [main] (current)
#   2) feature-login [feature-login]
#   3) hotfix-bug [hotfix/bug-fix]
#
# Select worktree (1-3): 2
# Opening feature-login in cursor...
```

**Direct selection:**
```bash
swt feature-login
# Directly opens the "feature-login" worktree
```

**Partial matching:**
```bash
swt login
# Matches "feature-login" worktree and opens it
```

**Print path for cd:**
```bash
cd $(swt -p)
# Interactive selection, then changes directory
```

**Combined with other commands:**
```bash
# Open in specific editor
code $(swt -p feature)

# Run command in worktree
git -C $(swt -p main) log --oneline -5
```

#### Interactive Selection with fzf

If `fzf` is installed, `swt` provides an enhanced selection experience:
- Fuzzy search through worktree names and branches
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Navigation with arrow keys
- Press `Enter` to select, `Esc` to cancel

**Installing fzf:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install fzf

# Linux
sudo apt-get install fzf  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install fzf      # Fedora
```

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GWT_EDITOR` | `cursor` | Editor to open worktree in |

---

### `uwt` - Update Worktrees

Update/pull git worktrees with remote tracking status.

#### Synopsis

```bash
uwt [OPTIONS]
```

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --all` | Update all worktrees without prompting |
| `-f, --force` | Update worktrees even with uncommitted changes |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

#### Behavior

1. **Fetches** latest changes from remote
2. **Analyzes** all worktrees for:
   - Remote tracking status (behind, ahead, up-to-date, diverged)
   - Uncommitted changes
3. **Displays** status summary for each worktree
4. **Prompts** which worktrees to update (unless `-a` is used)
5. **Updates** eligible worktrees using `git pull --ff-only`
6. **Displays** update summary (updated, failed, skipped)

#### Examples

**Interactive mode (default):**
```bash
uwt
# Output:
# Fetching latest from remote...
#
# Worktree Status:
# =================================================================
# 1. [OK] main [main] - up-to-date
# 2. [BEHIND] feature-login [feature-login] - behind
# 3. [AHEAD] feature-api [feature-api] - ahead
# 4. [BEHIND] hotfix [hotfix-123] - behind [DIRTY]
# 5. [NO-REMOTE] experiment [experiment] - no-remote
# =================================================================
#
# 2 worktree(s) can be updated.
# Update all updateable worktrees? [y/N]: y
```

**Update all worktrees automatically:**
```bash
uwt -a
# Updates all worktrees that are behind their remote
# without prompting
```

**Force update (including dirty worktrees):**
```bash
uwt -a -f
# Updates all worktrees, even those with uncommitted changes
# ⚠️ Use with caution!
```

#### Status Indicators

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `[OK]` | Up-to-date with remote |
| `[BEHIND]` | Local branch is behind remote (can be updated) |
| `[AHEAD]` | Local branch has commits not pushed to remote |
| `[DIVERGED]` | Local and remote have different commits |
| `[NO-REMOTE]` | No remote tracking branch configured |
| `[DIRTY]` | Has uncommitted changes |

#### Update Logic

**When a worktree is updated:**
- Status is `behind` (local is behind remote)
- Either clean OR `-f, --force` flag is used
- Uses `git pull --ff-only` to prevent accidental merges

**When a worktree is skipped:**
- Has uncommitted changes and `-f` flag is NOT used
- Is already up-to-date
- Is ahead, diverged, or has no remote

#### Example Output

```
Fetching latest from remote...

Worktree Status:
=================================================================
1. [OK] main [main] - up-to-date
2. [BEHIND] feature-login [feature-login] - behind
3. [BEHIND] hotfix [hotfix-bug] - behind
4. [AHEAD] feature-new [feature-new] - ahead
=================================================================

2 worktree(s) can be updated.
Update all updateable worktrees? [y/N]: y

Pulling feature-login...
   Updated feature-login
Pulling hotfix...
   Updated hotfix

=================================================================
Update Summary:
   Updated: 2
      - feature-login
      - hotfix
=================================================================
Done.
```

#### Safety Features

- **Fast-forward only**: Uses `--ff-only` to prevent merge commits
- **Uncommitted change protection**: Skips dirty worktrees unless `-f` is used
- **Fetch first**: Updates remote tracking info before analyzing
- **Detailed summary**: Shows exactly what was updated, failed, or skipped

---

## Security Features

The script includes comprehensive security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities:

### Input Validation

**Branch/Feature Name Validation:**
- Enforces git ref name rules
- Blocks shell metacharacters: `$`, `` ` ``, `|`, `&`, `;`, `<`, `>`
- Prevents git special characters: `~`, `^`, `:`, `?`, `*`, `[`, `@{`
- Blocks path traversal: `../`, `..`, double slashes `//`
- Enforces naming conventions (no leading `.`, trailing `.lock`)

**Configuration Value Sanitization:**
- Validates `EDITOR` for command injection patterns
- Sanitizes `COPY_FILES` and `COPY_DIRS` for unsafe characters
- Validates `WORKTREE_PATH` for path traversal and injection
- Falls back to safe defaults when invalid input is detected

### Command Injection Prevention

All user input is validated before being used in commands:
```bash
# Example: Prevents command injection in branch names
if [[ "$name" =~ [\$\`\(\)\|\&\;\<\>] ]]; then
  _gwt_print "Error: Feature name contains invalid characters"
  return 1
fi
```

### Path Traversal Protection

Prevents directory traversal attacks:
```bash
# Blocks attempts like: ../../../etc/passwd
if [[ "$name" == ../* ]] || [[ "$name" == */../* ]]; then
  _gwt_print "Error: Feature name cannot contain path traversal (../)"
  return 1
fi
```

### Safe Defaults

When configuration values fail validation:
- `EDITOR`: Falls back to `cursor`
- `COPY_FILES`: Falls back to `.env`
- `COPY_DIRS`: Falls back to empty (no directories)
- `AUTO_OPEN`: Falls back to `true`
- `WORKTREE_PATH`: Falls back to default pattern

### Cleanup on Failure

Partial worktree creations are cleaned up automatically:
```bash
trap _cleanup INT TERM EXIT

_cleanup() {
  if [[ $cleanup_needed -eq 1 ]]; then
    # Remove worktree directory
    git worktree remove "$cleanup_worktree_path" --force
    # Remove branch if it was created
    git branch -D "$cleanup_branch_name"
  fi
}
```

### Safe File Operations

- Uses absolute paths to prevent path confusion
- Validates directories exist before operations
- Uses `--force` flag carefully in git operations
- Checks for uncommitted changes before destructive operations

---

## Shell Compatibility

The script is designed to work seamlessly in both **bash** and **zsh** environments.

### Supported Shells

| Shell | Minimum Version | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| bash | 4.0+ | ✅ Fully Supported |
| zsh | 5.0+ | ✅ Fully Supported |

### Compatibility Layer

The script includes a cross-shell compatibility layer that abstracts shell-specific features:

#### Shell Detection
```bash
_gwt_detect_shell()
# Automatically detects bash or zsh
# Sets GWT_SHELL environment variable
```

#### Cross-Shell Print Function
```bash
_gwt_print()
# Unified print function for both shells
# Uses printf for maximum compatibility
```

#### Cross-Shell Read Prompt
```bash
_gwt_read_prompt "prompt text" variable_name
# Handles different read syntax between bash and zsh
# bash: read -r -p "prompt" varname
# zsh:  read -r "?prompt" varname
```

#### Cross-Shell Array Operations
```bash
_gwt_array_append array_name values...
# Abstracts array append operations
# Works identically in bash and zsh
```

#### Shell-Specific Options

**Zsh:**
```bash
emulate -L zsh
setopt local_options local_traps
setopt err_return pipe_fail no_unset
```

**Bash:**
```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

### Testing Your Shell

Check which shell you're using:
```bash
echo $SHELL
# /bin/bash or /bin/zsh

# Or check the version
bash --version
zsh --version
```

### Known Limitations

- Requires bash 4.0+ for associative arrays and modern features
- Requires zsh 5.0+ for proper array handling
- The script will error if run in unsupported shells (sh, dash, etc.)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development Workflow

**Scenario:** Working on a new feature while maintaining the ability to quickly fix bugs in production.

```bash
# Start in main repo
cd ~/projects/my-app

# Create worktree for new feature
cwt feature/user-dashboard
# Opens in editor automatically
# Files (.env, .claude, etc.) copied automatically

# Work on feature, make commits
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature/user-dashboard
git add .
git commit -m "Add user dashboard component"

# Bug report comes in - need to hotfix!
# Switch back to main without losing work
swt main
# Or create a hotfix worktree
cwt -e main hotfix-login-bug

# Fix the bug in hotfix worktree
cd ../my-app-worktrees/hotfix-login-bug
# ... make fixes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"
git push

# Back to feature work
swt feature/user-dashboard
# Continue working with all uncommitted changes intact

# Feature complete - cleanup
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature/user-dashboard
dwt
# Prompts to delete worktree and branch
```

### Example 2: Code Review Workflow

**Scenario:** Reviewing a pull request without affecting your current work.

```bash
# Currently working on feature-api
cd ~/projects/app-worktrees/feature-api

# PR comes in for review
# Create worktree from the remote branch
cwt -e origin/feature-authentication

# Review the code in a separate worktree
cd ../app-worktrees/feature-authentication
# ... review code ...
# Run tests, check functionality

# Leave comments, done with review
# Clean up the review worktree
dwt -f
# Force delete without prompts

# Back to your work immediately
swt feature-api
```

### Example 3: Multi-Version Testing

**Scenario:** Testing your app against multiple branches simultaneously.

```bash
# Main development branch
cd ~/projects/my-app

# Create worktrees for different versions
cwt -e main             # Production
cwt -e develop          # Staging
cwt feature-new-ui      # Your work

# List all worktrees to see status
lwt
# Shows all three worktrees with their status

# Start dev server in each (different ports)
cd ../my-app-worktrees/main
npm run dev -- --port 3000 &

cd ../my-app-worktrees/develop
npm run dev -- --port 3001 &

cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature-new-ui
npm run dev -- --port 3002 &

# Test all three versions simultaneously in browser
# localhost:3000 (production)
# localhost:3001 (staging)
# localhost:3002 (your feature)
```

### Example 4: Automated Release Process

**Scenario:** Script to update all worktrees before a release.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# release-prep.sh

echo "Preparing for release..."

# Update all worktrees
uwt -a

# Check status
lwt

# Switch to main for release
cd $(swt -p main)

# Run release script
npm run release
```

### Example 5: Emergency Hotfix with Dirty Worktree

**Scenario:** Need to make a hotfix but have uncommitted changes.

```bash
# Working on feature with uncommitted changes
cd ~/projects/app-worktrees/feature-complex

# Critical bug reported!
# Create hotfix worktree from production branch
cwt -e origin/production hotfix-critical

# Make fix
cd ../app-worktrees/hotfix-critical
# ... make urgent fix ...
git add .
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Fix critical security issue"
git push origin hotfix-critical

# Create PR, wait for merge

# Clean up hotfix worktree
dwt -f

# Return to feature work (uncommitted changes intact!)
swt feature-complex
# All your uncommitted work is still there
```

### Example 6: Team Collaboration

**Scenario:** Multiple team members' branches to test.

```bash
# Fetch latest from remote
git fetch --all

# Create worktrees for team members' branches
cwt -e origin/alice/feature-search
cwt -e origin/bob/feature-analytics
cwt -e origin/carol/feature-export

# Test each feature
swt alice
# Test Alice's feature

swt bob
# Test Bob's feature

swt carol
# Test Carol's feature

# Update all worktrees as team makes changes
uwt -a

# Clean up after testing
cd ../app-worktrees/alice/feature-search
dwt -f
cd ../app-worktrees/bob/feature-analytics
dwt -f
cd ../app-worktrees/carol/feature-export
dwt -f
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Not inside a git repository"

**Problem:** Running commands outside a git repository.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to your git repository first
cd ~/projects/my-app
git status  # Verify you're in a git repo

# Then run the command
cwt feature-test
```

---

#### 2. "Editor 'cursor' not found in PATH"

**Problem:** Configured editor is not installed or not in PATH.

**Solutions:**

**Option A - Install the editor:**
```bash
# For VS Code
# macOS
brew install --cask visual-studio-code

# Add to PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
```

**Option B - Change the editor:**
```bash
# Create/edit .git-worktree-config in repo root
echo "EDITOR=code" > .git-worktree-config
# or
echo "EDITOR=vim" > .git-worktree-config
```

**Option C - Set environment variable:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export GWT_EDITOR=vim
```

#### 3. "Branch 'feature-x' already exists"

**Problem:** Trying to create a new branch that already exists.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use -e flag to checkout existing branch
cwt -e feature-x

# Or choose a different name
cwt feature-x-v2
```

---

#### 4. "Worktree already exists at: ..."

**Problem:** Directory already exists at the worktree location.

**Solutions:**

**Option A - Use existing worktree:**
```bash
# Switch to it instead
swt feature-x
```

**Option B - Remove old worktree:**
```bash
cd path/to/existing/worktree
dwt -f
```

**Option C - Clean up git worktree registry:**
```bash
# If directory was manually deleted
git worktree prune
```

---

#### 5. File copying fails

**Problem:** "Warning: Failed to copy .env file"

**Possible Causes:**
- File doesn't exist in main repository
- Permission issues
- Invalid file name in config

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if file exists in main repo
ls -la .env

# Check permissions
ls -la .env
# If permission denied:
chmod 644 .env

# Verify config file
cat .git-worktree-config
# Ensure COPY_FILES is correctly formatted:
# COPY_FILES=.env,.env.local
```

---

#### 6. "You don't appear to be in a git worktree"

**Problem:** Running `dwt` from main repository or outside worktree.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check where you are
git rev-parse --git-dir
# If output is ".git", you're in main repo
# If output is ".git/worktrees/...", you're in a worktree

# Navigate to a worktree first
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature-x
dwt
```

---

#### 7. fzf not found (swt command)

**Problem:** `swt` works but without fuzzy finder.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install fzf for better experience
# macOS
brew install fzf

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install fzf

# Fedora
sudo dnf install fzf

# Or use numbered selection (fallback works fine)
```

---

#### 8. Uncommitted changes preventing update

**Problem:** `uwt` skips worktrees with uncommitted changes.

**Solutions:**

**Option A - Commit changes:**
```bash
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature-x
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Save progress"
# Then run uwt again
```

**Option B - Stash changes:**
```bash
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature-x
git stash
cd ~/projects/my-app
uwt -a
cd ../my-app-worktrees/feature-x
git stash pop
```

**Option C - Force update (⚠️ use carefully):**
```bash
uwt -a -f
# Updates even worktrees with uncommitted changes
```

---

#### 9. Invalid characters in branch name

**Problem:** "Error: Feature name contains invalid characters"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Avoid these characters: $ ` | & ; < > ~ ^ : ? * [ @{ .. //
# BAD:
cwt feature$123    # Contains $
cwt ../feature     # Path traversal
cwt feature..test  # Double dots

# GOOD:
cwt feature-123
cwt feature/login
cwt bugfix_auth
```

---

#### 10. Configuration not being loaded

**Problem:** Config file changes not taking effect.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify config file location
ls -la .git-worktree-config
# Must be in repository root (same level as .git/)

# Check file format
cat .git-worktree-config
# Format: KEY=value (no spaces around =)
# CORRECT:
# EDITOR=code
# WRONG:
# EDITOR = code

# Verify no hidden characters
cat -A .git-worktree-config
# Should show clean lines with $ at end

# Re-source your shell (if sourcing in shell config)
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

---

#### 11. Cleanup lock files

**Problem:** Stale `index.lock` files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find lock files
find ~/projects/my-app-worktrees -name "index.lock"

# Check if any process is using it
lsof /path/to/worktree/.git/index.lock

# If no process, remove it
rm /path/to/worktree/.git/index.lock
```

---

#### 12. Detached HEAD state in worktree

**Problem:** Worktree is in detached HEAD state.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current state
git status

# Create a branch from current state
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Or checkout an existing branch
git checkout existing-branch

# Or if you want to delete the worktree:
dwt -f
# (dwt handles detached HEAD properly)
```

---

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Add to script temporarily for debugging
set -x  # Enable trace
cwt feature-test
set +x  # Disable trace
```

---

### Getting Help

For each command, use the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```bash
cwt --help
dwt --help
lwt --help
swt --help
uwt --help
```
